# MeridianAlgo - Adaptive Trading Monitor

**MeridianAlgo** offers our unique take on popular trading bot strategies. As a non-profit, we leverage Alpaca's paper trading features for all "buy and sell" orders, focusing solely on research and development without financial gain. This project serves as a comprehensive tool for monitoring both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies, powered by an adaptive moving average (MA) formula.

## üåü Overview

This Node.js application provides real-time and historical price monitoring, advanced moving average analysis using the `QuantumMA` module, and automatic buy/sell signal generation for paper trading via Alpaca. It supports both stock and cryptocurrency markets, adapting its analysis to find the most effective moving average strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dual Market Support:** Monitor both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies (e.g., AAPL, BTC/USD).
* **Adaptive Moving Average (QuantumMA):**
    * Dynamically selects the best-performing MA type (SMA, EMA, WMA, Hull, ALMA, RMA, LINREG, VWMA) and length for given price data.
    * Utilizes a custom scoring mechanism and R-squared calculation to evaluate MA effectiveness.
    * Provides clear "Bullish," "Bearish," or "Neutral" trend indications.
    * Configurable `baseLength`, `evalPeriod`, `almaOffset`, and `almaSigma` for fine-tuning.
* **Real-time & Historical Data:** Fetches price data from Yahoo Finance, Finnhub, Polygon.io, and Alpaca's API (for crypto historical data).
* **Automatic Signals & Paper Trading:** Generates automatic buy/sell signals and executes simulated trades using Alpaca's paper trading API.
* **Market Status Checks:** Verifies market status for both stocks (Polygon.io) and crypto (Polygon.io & Alpaca asset status).
* **Configurable Timeframes:** Supports various timeframes (e.g., `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `1d` for stocks; `1Min`, `5Min`, `15Min`, `1Hour`, `1Day` for crypto).
* **Non-Profit Focus:** Dedicated to research and development; **no real money is used** in trades.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* **API Keys for:**
    * [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) (for paper trading and crypto historical data)
    * [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) (for market status checks)
    * [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) (for real-time price feeds)

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd MeridianAlgo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install @alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api axios dotenv node-cron ws yahoo-finance2 node-fetch
    ```
    *Note: `node-fetch` is specifically required for `cryptoMonitor.js` to interact with external APIs if needed, though Alpaca is primarily used now.*

## üîë Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:
- *ALPACA_API_KEY_ID=your_alpaca_key_id*

- *ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key*

- *POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key*

- *FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key*

* **All variables are required for full functionality.** The application will notify you if any are missing upon startup.

## üöÄ Usage

You can run the monitor for either stocks or cryptocurrencies from the command line.

### Monitoring Stocks

Run the stock monitor, providing a stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL`):

```sh
node stockMonitor.js AAPL
