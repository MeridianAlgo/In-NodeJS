# MeridianAlgo - Crypto Trading Monitor

**MeridianAlgo** offers our unique take on popular trading bot strategies. As a non-profit, we leverage Alpaca's paper trading features for all "buy and sell" orders, focusing solely on research and development without financial gain. This project is a dedicated tool for monitoring and paper trading cryptocurrencies.

## üåü Overview

The `cryptoMonitor.js` application is a Node.js-based tool for real-time and historical price monitoring of cryptocurrencies. It employs an adaptive moving average (MA) strategy, powered by the `QuantumMA` module, to analyze market trends and generate automatic buy/sell signals within Alpaca's paper trading environment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Cryptocurrency Focus:** Specifically designed for monitoring and trading crypto pairs (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD).
* **Adaptive Moving Average (QuantumMA):**
    * Dynamically selects the best-performing MA type (SMA, EMA, WMA, Hull, ALMA, RMA, LINREG, VWMA) and length for given price data.
    * Utilizes a custom scoring mechanism and R-squared calculation to evaluate MA effectiveness.
    * Provides clear "Bullish," "Bearish," or "Neutral" trend indications.
    * Configurable `baseLength`, `evalPeriod`, `almaOffset`, and `almaSigma` for fine-tuning.
* **Real-time & Historical Data:** Fetches real-time price data from Finnhub via WebSocket and historical OHLCV data from Alpaca's Crypto API.
* **Automatic Signals & Paper Trading:** Generates automatic buy/sell signals and executes simulated crypto trades using Alpaca's paper trading API.
* **Market Status Checks:** Verifies crypto market status through Polygon.io and confirms asset tradability via Alpaca.
* **Configurable Timeframes:** Supports various timeframes relevant to crypto markets (e.g., `1Min`, `5Min`, `15Min`, `1Hour`, `1Day`).
* **Non-Profit Focus:** Dedicated to research and development; **no real money is used** in trades.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* **API Keys for:**
    * [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) (for paper trading and crypto historical data)
    * [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) (for market status checks)
    * [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) (for real-time price feeds)

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd MeridianAlgo
    ```
    *(Assuming `cryptoMonitor.js` is in the root or a dedicated `crypto` folder you've navigated into)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install @alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api axios dotenv node-cron ws yahoo-finance2 node-fetch
    ```

## üîë Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (where `cryptoMonitor.js` resides) with the following variables:

````

ALPACA\_API\_KEY\_ID=your\_alpaca\_key\_id
ALPACA\_SECRET\_KEY=your\_alpaca\_secret\_key
POLYGON\_API\_KEY=your\_polygon\_api\_key
FINNHUB\_API\_KEY=your\_finnhub\_api\_key

````

* **All variables are required for full functionality.** The application will notify you if any are missing upon startup.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the crypto monitor from the command line, providing a crypto trading pair as an argument (e.g., `BTC/USD`):

```sh
node cryptoMonitor.js BTC/USD
````

  * You will be prompted to select a timeframe (e.g., `1Min`, `5Min`, `15Min`, `1Hour`, `1Day`).
  * The monitor will fetch historical data from Alpaca, verify market status, display initial analysis, and begin real-time monitoring via Finnhub WebSocket.
  * Buy/sell signals will be generated based on the adaptive MA, and paper trades will be executed using Alpaca's API.
