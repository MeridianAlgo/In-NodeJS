# CryptoMonitor Bot üö¶üìà

**Crypto Monitor**
*Version 2.0 ‚Äì Automated Crypto Trading, Now Smarter and Safer*

---

## What is CryptoMonitor?
CryptoMonitor is an advanced, open-source crypto trading bot for real-time market analysis and automated trading. It leverages robust moving average analytics, live price feeds, and multiple APIs to help you trade smarter. Version 2.0 introduces candle-close signal logic, improved error handling, persistent user preferences, and a legal/disclaimer section for your safety.

---

## ‚ú® What's New in v2.0
- **Candle-Close Signal Logic:** Signals (buy/long) are only generated after a new candle is fully closed, for all timeframes.
- **Race Condition Exit Logic:** Positions are closed by whichever comes first: take-profit, stop-loss, or a moving average crossunder (if enabled).
- **Persistent User Preferences:** Your settings (logging, TP/SL %, timeframe) are saved and can be reused or updated at startup.
- **Position & P&L Logging:** See your open positions and P&L at startup and during monitoring.
- **Bracket Orders:** Entry, take-profit, and stop-loss are managed as a single bracket order for crypto (per Alpaca docs).
- **Centralized Error Logging:** All API errors are logged to `api_errors.log` for easy troubleshooting.
- **Improved CLI UI:** Clear prompts, startup summaries, and error messages.
- **Legal & Compliance:** See the new Legal & Disclaimer section below.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Startup:** Launch the bot with a trading pair (e.g., `BTC/USD`).
2. **Preferences:** Use previous settings or enter new ones (logging, TP/SL, timeframe).
3. **API Checks:** Bot verifies all required API keys and connectivity.
4. **Market Status:** Confirms the market is open and the asset is tradable.
5. **Historical Data:** Fetches recent OHLCV bars for robust moving average analysis.
6. **Live Feed:** Subscribes to real-time price updates via Finnhub WebSocket.
7. **Signal Engine:** Analyzes price vs. adaptive moving averages (QuantumMA) to detect buy signals (on candle close).
8. **Trade Execution:** Executes trades on Alpaca with bracket orders and dynamic/user-defined risk controls.
9. **Exit Logic:** Closes positions on take-profit, stop-loss, or (optionally) MA crossunder‚Äîwhichever comes first.
10. **Logging:** Prints detailed status and trade logs to the terminal and logs errors to `api_errors.log`.
11. **Graceful Exit:** Handles Ctrl+C and errors cleanly, closing all connections.
