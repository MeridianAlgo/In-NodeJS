# MeridianAlgo/In-NodeJS

MeridianAlgo offers unique trading bot strategies implemented in Node.js. As a non-profit, we use Alpaca's paper trading for all buy/sell orders, focusing on research and development without financial gain.

## üåü Overview

This Node.js application provides tools for monitoring stocks and cryptocurrencies, powered by an adaptive moving average (MA) algorithm. It supports real-time/historical price tracking and automated paper trading via Alpaca.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Market Support**: Monitor stocks (e.g., AAPL) or cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC/USD).
- **Adaptive Moving Average (QuantumMA)**:
  - Dynamically selects optimal MA type (SMA, EMA, WMA, Hull, ALMA, RMA, LINREG, VWMA) and length.
  - Uses custom scoring and R-squared for MA effectiveness.
  - Outputs "Bullish," "Bearish," or "Neutral" trends.
  - Configurable parameters: `baseLength`, `evalPeriod`, `almaOffset`, `almaSigma`.
- **Data Sources**: Fetches real-time/historical data from Yahoo Finance, Finnhub, Polygon.io, and Alpaca (crypto).
- **Automated Paper Trading**: Generates buy/sell signals and executes simulated trades via Alpaca.
- **Market Status**: Checks stock/crypto market status using Polygon.io and Alpaca.
- **Timeframes**: Supports `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `1d` for stocks; `1Min`, `5Min`, `15Min`, `1Hour`, `1Day` for crypto.
- **Non-Profit**: Focused on research; no real money used.
